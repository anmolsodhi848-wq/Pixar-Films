**Pixar-Films**

Built interactive Tableau dashboards using an Excel movie dataset to analyze film ratings, box office performance, audience scores, and profitability metrics.

**Project Objective**

To evaluate the relationships between movie ratings, budgets, revenues, and audience engagement by developing comprehensive Tableau visualizations.

**Dataset**

2. Movie Genre - https://github.com/anmolsodhi848-wq/Pixar-Films/blob/main/Genre.csv

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

1. Average IMDB Score – Measures overall audience rating quality across films.
2. Average Rotten Tomatoes Score – Indicates critic sentiment and review strength.
3. Total Worldwide Box Office Revenue – Represents overall financial success of movies globally.
4. Profit Margin (%) – Evaluates the profitability of each film relative to its budget.
5. Return on Investment (ROI) – Measures how efficiently each film converted budget into revenue.
6. Average Budget – Tracks spending trends and production cost levels.
7. Total Box Office (US & Canada + Other Markets) – Shows revenue distribution across regions.
8. IMDB Rating Counts – Reflects audience engagement and rating volume.
9. Rotten Tomatoes Rating Counts – Shows critic participation and review volume.
10. Average Run Time – Helps identify patterns in film duration across categories.

**Process**

1. **Data Collection & Preparation:** Extracted the movie dataset from MS Excel, cleaned missing values, standardized formats, and organized fields such as ratings, box office figures, budget, and review scores.
2. **Data Transformation & Structuring:** Created calculated fields including profit margin, ROI, and score bins; categorized variables; and prepared the dataset for effective visualization in Tableau.
3. **Dashboard Development in Tableau**: Designed interactive dashboards featuring KPIs, charts, filters, and drill-downs to analyze performance metrics such as ratings, revenues, critic/audience scores, and profitability.
4. **Insight Generation & Validation:** Interpreted visual outputs to uncover trends and validated insights by comparing audience ratings, critic opinions, and revenue performance across films.
